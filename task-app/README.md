### Assignment 3

### STUDENT ID : 11354613

# Description of Task

This is the third assignment for the DCIT 202 (Mobile Application Development) course. The motive of this assignment is to is to create a task management mobile application using React Native. The app should have a user interface that closely matches the provided design mockup in the UI. The application utilizes a variety of core React Native components, such as View, Text, ScrollView, TextInput, Stylesheet, Button, FlatList, and Image. Additionally, the app should include at least eight task categories and display a list of 15 ongoing tasks. Custom components should be used throughout the application to ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience.

## Steps I used to create a new React Native blank template project using Expo CLI.

- Run `npm install -g expo-cli`
- Run `expo init  task-app -- template blank`
- Run `cd task-app` to navigate into the project directory
- Run `npm run android` to start the development server
- Enter `a` to select `open on android`

## How to run app if cloning from this repo.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/McEsselB/-rn-assignment3-11354613.git`
2. Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
3. Install various dependencies needed using: `npm install`
4. Start the development
   server: `expo start`
5. Open Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code displayed on the terminal OR to use an emulator, run command `a` after `expo start`, to live preview on android emulator.
